        <h1>Clean Up Structure  </h1>
        <div class="Body">The Clean Up Structure command is used to neaten the appearance of molecules by standardizing bond lengths and angles. Graphic objects, such as arrows and aromatic circles, are not affected. You can use this command to redraw structures that you may have drawn freehand, or to neaten structures that you may have imported from another application. For certain compounds, the Clean Up Structure command produces a structure that extends beyond the bounds of the page. To view the entire structure, scale the structure or increase the size of the page.</div>
        <p>The Clean Up Structure feature follows these rules:</p>
        <div class="Bullet1-inner">Bonds are set to the target Fixed Length specified in the document settings.</div>
        <div class="Bullet1-inner">A ring is redrawn only if all of its bonds are selected.</div>
        <div class="Bullet1-inner">Multi-attached atom labels, variable attachment points, and multi-center bonds cannot be cleaned.</div>
        <div class="Bullet1-inner">Structures are rotated so that as many bonds as possible are directed at a multiple of 15 degrees.</div>
        <div class="Bullet1-inner">Clean Up Structure preserves stereochemical meaning rather than the precise identity of wedged, or hashed bonds, as shown below.</div>

        <p>To use Clean Up Structure:</p>
        <div class="numlist1-1st" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Select the structure, or part of the structure, to clean up.</div>
        <div class="numlist1-inner" MadCap:autonum="2. ">Use "Clean Up Structure" tool in toolbar, or type <i>&lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Ctrl&gt;+K</i> (<i>&lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Command&gt;</i>+K on macOS) .</div>
        <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt; ">The Clean Up Structure command redraws your structure in iterations. Therefore, you may need to click the tool more than once.</div>
        <div class="Body">You can also clean up a reaction. For more information, see "<a href="Drawing Reactions.htm#Clean">Clean Up Reactions</a>"</div>
