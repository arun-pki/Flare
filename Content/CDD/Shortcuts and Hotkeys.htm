        <h1>Shortcuts and Hotkeys</h1>
        <div class="Body">There are three types of hotkeys-atom hotkeys, bond hotkeys and generic hotkeys. Atom hotkeys apply an action on an atom hotspot whereas bond hotkeys apply an action on a bond hotspot and generic hotkeys apply an action while the cursor is not over any hotspot. Shortcuts are organized by the menu on which the command is found.

</div>
        <div class="Body">In <MadCap:variable name="Primary.ProductName" />, the way different hotkeys function have been modified extensively and some new hotkeys have been introduced to cover a wide range of possible organic functional groups.

</div>
        <div class="Body">Hotkeys apply an action to hotspot which can be an atom or the bond. With a selection tool, mousing over an atom or bond will activate it as a hotspot. The hotspot is now indicated as a light blue rectangle for bonds and a light blue circle with a green dot for atoms. Simply pressing the arrow keys on a molecule moves the hotspot from atom to bond to atom to bond. Holding <i>&lt;Shift&gt;</i> while pressing arrow keys will make the hotspot jump from atom to atom or bond to bond, as a quicker way to navigate around the molecule.</div>
