        <h1>Arrows</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Feature Note.flsnp" />
        <div class="Body">Use the Arrow Tool, <img src="../Resources/Images/arrow_new.gif" />, to add arrows to show the conversion of reactants to products. Draw a reaction arrow to assign the role (reactant/reagent or product) to the components in a reaction. ChemDraw JS offers a variety of arrow types, such as solid arrow, dashed arrow, crossed (no-go) arrow, resonance arrow, and hollow arrow. Long click the Arrow Tool to get the arrow types menu <img src="../Resources/Images/long_click_arrow.gif" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;mc-thumbnail-max-height: 50px;" />, and click the required arrow type. After selecting the required arrow type, click in the drawing area to insert the arrow where you want it.</div>
        <div class="Bullet1-inner">To move the arrow within the drawing area, use the Selector Tool to select it, and drag the arrow to the new location. </div>
        <div class="Bullet1-inner">The length of the arrow can be adjusted by dragging while drawing an arrow.</div>
        <p><b>Notes</b>: </p>
        <div class="Bullet1-inner">If you have a complex drawing, with multiple components that extend beyond the drawing window perimeter (a multiple-line reaction), the drawing will not be supported if it extends beyond (or beneath) the first line of the drawing. This means that although your drawing appears in the drawing window, if you try to apply a ChemDraw tool, for example, Reaction Cleanup, this tool will not work.</div>
        <div class="Body">In the following example, the Arrow Tool illustrates the reactant, 2-methylpropan-2-ol, and the product, 2-chloro-2-methylpropane. </div>
